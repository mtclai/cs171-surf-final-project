In the design studio, we got feedback from Vlad Bok and Tarik Moon. They gave some fair and useful feedback. First, they were concerned that the scope might be a little small. We agree, because there's not a huge amount of quantitative data in our dataset. 

Another piece of feedback was filtering the dataset by qualitatitive dimensions. Thus far, we had considered simply filtering out surf spots that did not fit a certain criteria, but Vlad and Tarik suggested instead keeping all of the spots, and sizing the surf spots based on different dimensions. This is a valid suggestion, and works with a few surf spots, though it may be intractable with our full dataset of 8500 surf spots.  	

Along these lines, one feature suggestion was a feed to the right of the map that represented a rank ordering of surf spots that match the user's filtering most closely. Essentially, this is search engine functionality. This may be too much for the scope of the project, but it does meet our core objective of building a recommendation tool for different types of surfers. 

Finally, a suggestion was to utilize iconography to represent some of our qualitative data. For example, one of our qualitative dimensions is the type of surfsuit suggested for the spot. Given that there are only a few different types of surfsuits, we could consider replacing the dots with an icon of the right suit.  

In terms of addressing the feedback in our future revisions, we will certainly add functionality that allows resizing surf spots based on various dimensions.
