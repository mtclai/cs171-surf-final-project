#Design Studio 3 

In this design studio, we got feedback from Vlad Bok and Tarik Moon. They gave mostly very helpful and useful feedback, although some of it may not be feasible. First, they were concerned that the scope might be a little small. We agree, and will work on bumping up the scope moving forward, because there's not a huge amount of quantitative data in our dataset. 

Second, they gave us feedback about filtering the data by qualitative dimensions. Thus far, we had considered simply filtering out surf spots that did not fit a certain criteria, but Vlad and Tarik suggested instead keeping all of the spots, and sizing all the surf spots based on different dimensions. This is a valid suggestion, and works with a few surf spots, though it may be intractable with our full dataset of 8500 surf spots.  	

Along these lines, one feature suggestion was a feed to the right of the map that represented a rank ordering of surf spots that match the user's filtering most closely. Essentially, this is search engine functionality. While this meets our core objective of building a recommendation tool for different types of surfers, it may be too much for the scope of the project. Nevertheless, ranking the data and presenting it in a feed format is interesting avenue to explore, especially because it helps us visualization the vast amount of qualitative data we have for each surf spot.

Finally, they suggested utilize iconography to represent some of our qualitative ordinal data. For example, one of our qualitative dimensions is the type of surfsuit suggested for the spot. Given that there are only a few different types of surfsuits, we could consider replacing the dots with an icon of the right suit.  

In terms of addressing the feedback in our future revisions, we will certainly add functionality that allows resizing surf spots based on various dimensions, and considering additional ways we can increase scope, such as adding a ranked feed.
